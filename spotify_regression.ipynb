    "# (Kernel) Ridge Regression\n",
    "Download the Spotify Tracks Dataset and perform ridge regression to predict the tracksâ€™ popularity. Note that this dataset contains both numerical and categorical features. The student is thus required to follow these guidelines:\n",
    "- first, train the model using only the numerical features,\n",
    "- second, appropriately handle the categorical features (for example, with one-hot encoding or other techniques) and use them together with the numerical ones to train the model, in both cases, experiment with different training parameters, \n",
    "- use 5-fold cross validation to compute your risk estimates, thoroughly discuss and compare the performance of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The student is required to implement from scratch (without using libraries, such as Scikit-learn) the code for the ridge regression, while it is not mandatory to do so for the implementation of the 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: Instead of regular ridge regression, implement kernel ridge regression using a Gaussian kernel.\n"
