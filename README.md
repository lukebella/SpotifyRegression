![Python Version from PEP 621 TOML](https://img.shields.io/python/required-version-toml?tomlFilePath=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flukebella%2FSpotifyRegression%2Fmain%2Fpyproject.toml)

In this project we develop a prediction system that estimates the popularity of a song. The flow of this work starts with the manipulation of the dataset: ''[Spotify Track Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)''. The training and estimation parts, together with k-fold nested cross validation and kernel functions, are developed from scratch and compared with the `scikit-learn` operations.
